Toolbar Plugins Link customizes the Admin Toolbar and adds a shortcut to the plugins page.

== Description ==

An ultralight plugin to customize the admin <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/toolbar/" title="WordPress support article on Toolbar">Toolbar</a> and add a shortcut to the plugins page.

Ever felt the need to navigate to the Plugins page *directly* from the site front-end? Well. This plugin does just that. Nothing more. Nothing less. Saves the hassle of going to the dashboard and then navigating to the Plugins page.

In the site front-end, a link will be added to the admin toolbar that takes you to the Plugins page in the site back-end. Note that this feature will be available only for the users who can install/activate/update plugins.

This functionality is particularly useful during the development of the website.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin and unzip it.
2. Upload the folder `toolbar-plugins-link` to your `/wp-content/plugins/` folder.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
